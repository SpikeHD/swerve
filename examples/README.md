# Benchmark examples

Included are some benchmark comparisons of different HTTP servers you may use. The intention here is not to make them look bad,
especially due to the fact that a 400Âµs response time increase is really not a human-noticeable difference.

Rather, I just think it's fun to compare things, and its interesting (though largely pointless) to see the differences between
different tools.

## Run the benchmarks

To run a benchmark, run `cargo run --example <benchmark-name>`.
